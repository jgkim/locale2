# locale
Try as hard as possible to get that browser locale like en-US.

## Notes
I intentionally made the code look like an OCD's dream because
code is poetry so I got all artsy with it. I also smoked __A LOT__.

## Contribute
I'd love to grow this project with some more l8n, i18n pizzaz.

## Use
```
var locale = require('locale');
> locale
en-US
>
```

## Try it!

If we can't detect your locale, then we'll give you your money back! it's win-win!
